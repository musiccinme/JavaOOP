# JavaOOP
The "Java OOP" course teaches the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), working with classes and objects, using object-oriented modeling, and building class hierarchies. Basic principles of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism are studied. We will go into the most commonly used design patterns. We will pay attention to component testing (writing unit tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD), the use of reflection.

Students receive a certificate for completing the exam with an excellent mark.
